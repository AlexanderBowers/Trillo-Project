# README

we have three models:
a board model, used so a user can start from scratch
a task model, so a user can add tasks they need to complete
a list model, so users can separate their various tasks
a board will have many lists
a list will have many tasks
a user can mark tasks as complete
a list will be marked as complete when all tasks are complete
users can crud lists
users can crud tasks
stretch goal: allow users to swap between multiple boards


We will be using four branches

a stable master
Matt on Frontend branch
Alex on backend branch
a testing branch for both our changes

keeping track of our tasks with Trello
